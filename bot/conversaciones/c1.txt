And what do you do?
I’m unemployed and live with my parents.
Oh, that’s nice. What do you like doing in your free time?
I like playing video games and watching TV. What about you?
I’m more active. I like rock-climbing and mountain biking. I have a lot of fun.
Wow. Where do you live?
I live in an apartment close to here. The rent is expensive, but it’s a nice place.
